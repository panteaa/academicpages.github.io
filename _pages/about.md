I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science](https://cs.uic.edu/) at the [University of Illinois at Chicago](https://www.uic.edu/), working with my advisor Professor [Debaleena Chattopadhyay](http://debaleena.com/). I received my BS in Computer Engineering from [Amirkabir University of Technology](https://aut.ac.ir/en/), Tehran, Iran.


My research areas generally lie in Human-Computer Interaction, and my current projects mainly focus on mid-air interactions in virtual and augmented reality environments.
